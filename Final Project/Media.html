                        <h3>Football Description</h3>
                        <p>What is the origin of football? Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Though “folk football” had been played since medieval times with varying rules, the game began to be standardized when it was taken up as a winter game at public schools.</p>

                        <h3>Football Stadium</h3>
                        <p>The yard lines on the football field are white vertical lines running the width of the field in 10-yard increments. The numbers run from 10 to 50 and then back to 10. Each yard line is numbered. In the NFL and in major college football, next to each number is an arrow, pointing towards the closest end zone.</p>

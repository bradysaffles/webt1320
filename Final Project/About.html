                        <h3>Goal Post Position</h3>
                        <p>The goal post in football is a large yellow post located at the back of each end zone on the end line. Goal posts have a horizontal bar called the crossbar and two vertical bars called the uprights.The uprights will extend 30 feet above the crossbar and will be no less than 3 inches and no more than 4 inches in diameter. An orange-colored ribbon 4 inches by 42 inches is to be attached to the top of each post.</p>

                        <h3>Team/Defensive Position</h3>
                        <p>A football team is typically made up of 11 members: 1 goalkeeper and 10 outfield players who take on defensive, midfield and attacking positions. Unlike other players on the field, goalkeepers do not change positions or occupy large stretches of the field. Goalkeepers usually stay within the penalty area.The defense's primary job, as a team, is to keep the offense from scoring â€” by tackling members of the offense, intercepting the ball, and generally preventing the offense from moving the ball close enough to their goal to create a scoring opportunity.</p>
